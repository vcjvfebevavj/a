## Asana CLI

CLI and general utility library for working with http://asana.com/[Asana]

This is so very far from ready to use you should not bother, except to
see use of the API maybe.

## Design Thoughts

Asana's API is ridiculously slow, therefore in order to make
interaction reasonably snappy we will start a daemon which the CLI
will talk to to enqueue work. 

The daemon will also periodically poll for updates on the server in
order to keep the local cache accurate.

We should show client side views of things that are queued, for
example we should show new tasks that have not made it to the server
yet, but we should highlight that they are only available locally
(until the sync occurs). Likewise deletes, etc.



## Working and Building

Don't panic. We have a Makefile. The makefile manages the *project*
not the build.

It can make a build, of course, but that is just a useful thing, not
the general way of building.

If you want to work on this and have a workspace and everything set up
for you, my recommendation is to do this:

    $ make activate
    
This sets up the workspace, moves you into it in a subprocess, etc. To
stop working on the project just exit the sub-shell (C-d or `exit`).
